# biologging-templates

The following templates contain links to definitions, vocabularies and examples of use within standards.

* [S1:Device Metadata Template](device-metadata.md)
* [S2:Deployment Metadata Template](deployment-metadata.md)
* [S4:Input Data Template](input-data.md)

Each field links to examples of expressions for two sets of standards:
1. OCG Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) standards. The Sensor Model Language (SensorML, https://www.ogc.org/standards/sensorml), describing sensors and their operations, combined with Observations and Measurements (https://www.ogc.org/standards/om, https://www.iso.org/standard/32574.html), describing sensor output,  enable syntactic interoperability for the IoT. 
2. Darwin Core. The Darwin Core set of standards facilitates interoperability of biodiversity data, and is commonly used by  aggregator repositories. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0029715
